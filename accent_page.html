American accent:
</div>
</div>
<p2 style="font-size: large">
<br><br>For the American accent, there are several sounds that are different to most English-speaking places.<br>For starters, the "R" sound in American is a lot more prominent than in other countries.<br>For most places, in words like "are", and "car", the "R" sound isn't really obvious. The words sound more like "ah", and "cah".<br>But make sure you don't overdo your "R" sound - don't go "caRRrrRr", go "carr"<br>The second sound we are focusing are the T's in the middle of words.<br>Words like "little" and "brittle", sound more like "liddle" and "briddle".<br>The final sound to learn is the vowel sounds in the words "cot", "caught", "law", "long", etc. In all of these words, the sound is the same.<br>Listen to this audio clip to hear all of these sounds, instead of just reading them:

        Australian accent:
        <br><br>
    </div>
    <p2 style="font-size: large">
        In Australian accentage, you do not want to pronounce the "r" sounds much if at all.<br>For example, r's at the end of words become ah's. So "river" would become "riv-ah". "Car" would become "cah".<br>If a word ends with "-ing", cut off the "g", so it becomes "-in". For example, "running" would become "runnin".<br>This tip is for sentences in general - at the end of each sentence, raise the tone of your voice in an upward inflection.<br>When pronouncing the vowel "a" as in "way", the vowel sound becomes more of an "ai" sound. Remember, don't overdo this sound, or you'll sound ridiculous. "no wai mate!"<br>Another "a" sound to work on, such as in the word "ant", "man", or "camera". This vowel becomes more of an "e" as in egg. "Thets a great cemera!"<br>Listen to this audio clip to hear all these tricks spoken out loud:
